# Product dataset generator

This python script is written to be used as a random dataset generator.
The dataset that is generated simulates a company that sells different products to customers in different cities.
In the main function the years, cities, products and number of rows can be defined.
The dataset generated this way is a great way to practice anything that uses datasets.
